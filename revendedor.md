Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

For example:



| Time        | price         |
| ----------- |:-------------:|
| 09:00       | 10            |
| 09:30       | 7             |
| 10:00       | 5             |
| 10:30       | 8             |
| 11:00       | 11            |
| 11:30       | 9             |


```javascript
  var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
// returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
```
No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
